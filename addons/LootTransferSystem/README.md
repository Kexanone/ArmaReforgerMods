# Loot Transfer System

This mod adds the QoL feature to transfer loots.

This mod adds the following interactions:
- On dead bodies: Load loot to nearest vehicle
- On Freedom Fighters storage boxes: Unload loot from nearest vehicle

Modding:
- Custom storage boxes can be made compatible with this system by adding `LTS_UnloadLootAction` to the `ActionsManagerComponent` of the storage box.
